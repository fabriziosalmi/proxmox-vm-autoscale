# Global thresholds for scaling VMs
scaling_thresholds:
  cpu:
    high: 80            # Percentage CPU usage at which scaling up is triggered
    low: 20             # Percentage CPU usage at which scaling down is considered
  ram:
    high: 85            # Percentage RAM usage at which scaling up is triggered
    low: 25             # Percentage RAM usage at which scaling down is considered

# Scaling limits for VMs
scaling_limits:

# Time intervals for checking VM resources and performing actions (in seconds)
